  - Only applies when order moves toward market center (economically beneficial)
  - Prevents wasted on-chain transactions for imperceptible price changes
  - Maintains grid integrity by pushing orders toward spread

### Fixed
- Eliminated zero-delta price-only updates that had no economic effect
- Improved order update efficiency for partial order price adjustments
